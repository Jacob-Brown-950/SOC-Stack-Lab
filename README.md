# SOC Stack Lab

## Objective

The goal of this project is to set up a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) stack lab using open-source tools to enhance network monitoring and security analysis. The SOC stack will be implemented on a physical server in my home lab environment.

The core components of the stack include:

Wazuh: Deployed as the primary Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, Wazuh will provide real-time security monitoring, log analysis, and threat detection.
Grafana: Integrated with Wazuh to visualize and analyze security metrics and logs through dynamic dashboards and graphical representations.

This setup aims to monitor network activities effectively, detect potential security threats, and gain insights into system performance. The lab will serve as a practical environment for testing and refining SOC operations, enhancing my ability to manage and respond to security incidents in a controlled setting.
