# SOC Stack Lab

## Objective

The goal of this project is to set up a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) stack lab using open-source tools to enhance network monitoring and security analysis. The SOC stack will be implemented on a physical server in my home lab environment.

The core components of the stack include:

Wazuh: Deployed as the primary Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, Wazuh will provide real-time security monitoring, log analysis, and threat detection.

Grafana: Separate Dashboard Integrated with Wazuh to visualize and analyze security metrics and logs through dynamic dashboards and graphical representations.
